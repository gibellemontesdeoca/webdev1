         <h3>Crime</h3>
         <p>Ted Bundy sexually assaulted and killed many young women in Washington, Oregon, Colorado, Utah, and Florida between the years 1974-1978. Although he confessed to 28 murders, he is suspected of hundreds. He intended to kill young, attractive women and he put on this persona as a disabled man by walking in crutches or having a fake cast. He would gain the trust of these women by often times helping them unload things into their car. He would sometimes take on the persona of a cop or someone of authority to further gain trust. Once he could get them in his car, he would strike them over the head with a crowbar or pipe which would knock them out for a while. During this time, he would rape the women as the were unconscious. He typically strangled and mutilated his victims. He escaped police custody once and immediately went on to kill at least 5 more women in Florida.  </p>

The jury returned a verdict of guilty, and he sentenced Ted Bundy to death twice in the form of the electric chair. At this point, there was an overwhelming amount of forensic evidence and eye witnesses. The jury once again announced a guilty verdict and he was put to death by electrocution on January 24, in Florida where he died at the age of 42. </p>
